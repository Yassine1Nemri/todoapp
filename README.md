# Todo App - DevSecOps Project 🚀

A demonstration of DevSecOps practices with a simple Todo web application.

## 🔒 Security First Approach

This project implements security at every stage of development and deployment:

### Built-in Security Features
- **XSS Prevention**: Input sanitization and validation
- **Input Validation**: Length limits and content filtering  
- **Secure Headers**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- **Container Security**: Non-root user, minimal attack surface
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection

## 🛠️ DevSecOps Pipeline

### Development Phase
1. **Secure Coding**: Input validation, XSS prevention
2. **Static Analysis**: ESLint security rules, Semgrep scanning
3. **Unit Testing**: Security-focused test cases

### Security Phase
1. **Dependency Scanning**: npm audit, Snyk integration
2. **Container Scanning**: Trivy for Docker vulnerabilities
3. **Code Analysis**: Automated security pattern detection

### Operations Phase
1. **Secure Deployment**: Non-root containers, health checks
2. **Monitoring**: Real-time security and performance monitoring
3. **Incident Response**: Automated alerting and logging

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- Docker (optional)
- Git

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd my-todo-devsecops

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run security checks
npm run security:audit

# Start development server
npm start
```

### Running with Docker
```bash
# Build secure container
npm run docker:build

# Run container
npm run docker:run
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run only security tests
npm run test:security

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

## 📊 Monitoring

```bash
# Check application health
npm run monitor

# View security scan results
npm run security:scan
```

## 🔍 Security Scanning

### Automated Scans
- **Dependencies**: npm audit, Snyk
- **Container**: Trivy vulnerability scanner
- **Code**: Semgrep, ESLint security rules
- **Runtime**: Health checks, monitoring

### Manual Security Review
1. Input validation mechanisms
2. Output encoding practices
3. Authentication/authorization (when implemented)
4. Error handling and information disclosure

## 📈 CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions pipeline includes:

1. **Security Scanning** (First Priority)
   - Dependency vulnerabilities
   - Static code analysis
   - Container scanning

2. **Testing & Quality**
   - Unit tests
   - Security tests
   - Code linting

3. **Build & Deploy**
   - Secure container build
   - Staging deployment
   - Production deployment

4. **Monitoring**
   - Health checks
   - Performance monitoring
   - Security monitoring

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
LOG_LEVEL=info
MONITOR_INTERVAL=30000
```

### Security Configuration
- CSP headers for XSS protection
- HSTS for secure connections
- X-Frame-Options for clickjacking protection

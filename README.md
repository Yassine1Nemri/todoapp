# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - DevSecOps Without API Keys

This guide will get you up and running with a complete DevSecOps pipeline using **100% free tools** that require **no API keys or registration**.

## 📋 What You Get (All Free!)

✅ **NPM Audit** - Built-in dependency scanning  
✅ **Retire.js** - JavaScript vulnerability detection  
✅ **Semgrep** - Static code analysis  
✅ **OSV Scanner** - Google's vulnerability database  
✅ **Trivy** - Container security scanning  
✅ **ESLint Security** - Code security rules  
✅ **Secret Detection** - Find hardcoded credentials  

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Your Project Structure
```bash
mkdir my-todo-devsecops
cd my-todo-devsecops

# Create the folder structure
mkdir -p src tests/unit tests/security .github/workflows docker security monitoring
```

### Step 2: Copy the Files

1. **Main App**: Copy the Todo web app HTML into `src/index.html`
2. **Package.json**: Copy the package configuration 
3. **Dockerfile**: Copy the secure container configuration
4. **GitHub Actions**: Copy the CI/CD pipeline to `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
5. **Security Script**: Copy the security scanner to `security/free-security-scan.sh`

### Step 3: Initialize Git & GitHub

```bash
# Initialize git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial DevSecOps setup"

# Create GitHub repository (on GitHub.com)
# Then connect it:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-todo-devsecops.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Test Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the security scanner
chmod +x security/free-security-scan.sh
./security/free-security-scan.sh

# Start the app
npm start
```

## 🔒 What Happens When You Push Code?

The GitHub Actions pipeline automatically:

1. **Scans for vulnerabilities** in your dependencies
2. **Analyzes your code** for security issues  
3. **Checks for secrets** in your code
4. **Scans your Docker container** for vulnerabilities
5. **Runs security tests** on your application
6. **Generates security reports** you can download

## 📊 Viewing Results

After pushing code to GitHub:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the **"Actions"** tab
3. Click on your latest workflow run
4. Download the **"security-reports"** artifact to see detailed results

## 🛡️ Security Features Built-In

Your app already includes:

- **XSS Prevention**: User input is sanitized
- **Input Validation**: Length limits and content filtering
- **Secure Container**: Runs as non-root user
- **Security Headers**: Protection against common attacks
- **Error Handling**: Doesn't leak sensitive information

## 🔧 Customizing Your Pipeline

### Add More Security Scans
Edit `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` to add:
- More Semgrep rules
- Additional static analysis tools
- Custom security tests

### Modify Security Rules
Edit `security/free-security-scan.sh` to:
- Add custom secret patterns
- Include more file checks
- Customize report formats

### Enhance Your App
Add security features to `src/index.html`:
- Content Security Policy headers
- More input validation
- Authentication (for future versions)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy to a Cloud Platform**:
   - Vercel (free tier)
   - Netlify (free tier)  
   - GitHub Pages (free)

2. **Add More Security**:
   - User authentication
   - Rate limiting
   - HTTPS enforcement

3. **Improve Monitoring**:
   - Error tracking
   - Performance monitoring
   - Security alerting

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Check the Actions tab** regularly for security findings
- **Update dependencies** weekly with `npm update`
- **Review security reports** from each pipeline run
- **Add new security tests** as you add features

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: Pipeline fails on first run  
**Solution**: Make sure all files are in the correct folders

**Issue**: Security scanner finds issues  
**Solution**: Review the generated reports and fix flagged items

**Issue**: Docker build fails  
**Solution**: Check that Dockerfile is in the `docker/` folder
